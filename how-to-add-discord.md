# How to add Discord

Connect your Discord server to Guild so you can give members Discord roles as rewards and easily onboard your community.

### Connect Discord to your Guild

**1. Add Guild bot to your Discord server**

* Go to your role's rewards section and click **"Add reward"**
* Select **Discord** from the reward options
* Select which Discord server you want to connect (you must be an admin of that server to see it listed)
* Click the **"Invite"** button in the popup and complete the authorization process
* Return to adding a Discord reward and select your connected server
* Create a new Discord role on Guild or Guildify an existing Discord role
* Members can claim the Discord role automatically when they meet your requirements

**2. Set bot permissions**

* **Important:** Move the Guild bot to the top of your Discord server's "Roles" tab (this ensures it can manage roles below it)
* The bot needs specific permissions to work properly:
  * **Must-have:** Manage Roles (required to give/remove Discord roles)
  * **Recommended:** Manage Server, Create Invite (helps with server management and invite creation)
  * **Good-to-have:** Manage Channels, Send Messages, Embed Links (needed for join buttons)\


**3. Drive Discord members to Guild**

* Create a **"get-roles"** channel on your Discord server
* Write a description explaining what roles members can claim and why they should join
* Share your Guild link (alpha.guild.xyz/YOURPROJECT)
* Pin the message so it's always visible to new members

{% hint style="info" %}
Create Discord roles that match your Guild roles - like "Verified Member" or "Token Holder" - so the connection is clear.
{% endhint %}

#### How it works for members

**Simple flow:**

1. Members can discover your Guild through Discord or find your Discord through Guild
2. They connect their Discord account to their Guild profile
3. They complete the requirements you've set
4. They automatically receive the Discord role
5. They gain access to gated channels and perks

**What's next:** Most projects manage all their Discord roles through Guild. If you have existing Discord roles, you can connect them to Guild roles without creating new ones.
