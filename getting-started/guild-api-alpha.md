Once your guild has been created, you can start customizing it to match your project and community needs.

### Customize your guild



1. **Access your admin dashboard:**

* Click the settings icon (top right) to enter admin mode
* This is your control center where you can customize your guild's appearance, structure, and view all guild details

2. **Brand your guild:**

* Upload your logo (150x150px works best)
* Edit the page title, URL, and description to introduce your project
* Click **"Theme"** to upload a cover image (optimal size: 1920x1080px)\


3. **Organize your content:**

* Click **"Add page"** to create separate sections for campaigns, onboarding, or different community groups
* Drag pages to reorder them in your preferred sequence
* Each page can have its own focus, but keep your home page simple and clear since members will see this first

4. **Configure the basics:**

* Go to the **Settings** tab in your admin dashboard
* Edit your guild name and main URL (this becomes your permanent guild link)
* Add your social media accounts (format: https://x.com/yourproject) - these appear on your home page for easy discovery
* Customize the appearance with surface and accent (button) colors that match your brand
* Choose your role style throughout your guild: **glass** (transparent), **acrylic** (semi-transparent), or **solid** (opaque)
