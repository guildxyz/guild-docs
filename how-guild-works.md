# How Guild works

Guild organizes your community using three building blocks: Requirements, Roles, and Rewards.

Think of it like a simple rule system:

**Requirements** → What people need to do

**Roles** → Groups you organize people into

**Rewards** → What group members get

### Requirements

Requirements are the conditions people must meet. These can be:

* **Onchain activity** - Own $TOKEN/NFT, make 5 transactions on Ethereum, interact with XYZ smart contract
* **Social proof** - Follow on X, hold Discord role “Member”, verify email
* **Guild activity** - Have 50+ points, have XYZ guild role
* **Time-based** - Have a Discord role before Jan 1st, have a transaction in the last 7 days on Base

You can combine requirements with AND/OR logic. Example: "Hold $TOKEN AND Follow on X" or Hold $TOKEN OR Stake $TOKEN.

Set “Should not satisfy” requirements to exclude people.

### Roles

Roles are groups you create based on requirements.

Examples:

* Role: **Early Supporter** _role_ - Requirement&#x73;_:_ Waitlist subscriber AND Genesis NFT holder&#x20;
* Role: **Active User** - Requirements: Have an interaction with the XYZ contract in the last 30 days AND hold a Discord role
* Role: **OG Member** - Requirements: Have the “Early Supporter” AND the “Active Contributor” role AND Stake $TOKEN

Members automatically gain or lose roles when they meet or stop meeting requirements. No manual management needed.

### Rewards

Rewards are what role members get once they meet requirements. These include:

* **Platform access** - Discord/Telegram groups, content, forms
* **Digital rewards** - Points, NFTs and tokens
* **Real perks** - Merchandise, event tickets, early access

### Example flow

1. Create role: "Token holders"
2. Set requirement: "Hold 500+ $TOKEN"
3. Add rewards: Token holder Discord role + 5 points
4. Members with 500+ tokens automatically get the Discord role and 5 points
5. If they sell tokens and drop below 500, they lose role & rewards automatically

Set rules once. Guild handles everything else.
