# Add Guild roles

#### 2. Set up your first role

* You can start configuring the first default role called "Member"
* Upload role image (optimal size: 128x128)
* Edit role title and description&#x20;
* Add requirements to gate access to this role and its rewards&#x20;
* You can edit the requirement image and text, or keep the default settings
* Select "Should not satisfy" if you want to exclude members
* You can customize how many requirements members must satisfy at the top ("Should meet...")
* Add reward(s) that your members can get once they satisfy the requirement(s)
* Save changes
* Create new roles by clicking on the "Empty role" button below the roles&#x20;

#### 3. Preview and launch

* Use **"View page as a visitor"** to see exactly what members will experience
* Check that requirements work correctly and rewards are set up properly
* Make sure your branding and messaging are clear

**Go live:**

* Once everything looks good, your **Guild URL** is ready to share
* Start with your existing community on Discord, Twitter, or Telegram
* You can always add more roles, pages, and features as your community grows

**Next steps:** Most projects start simple with one gated role, then build out quests, membership tiers, and specialized roles over time.
