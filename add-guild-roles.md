# Add Guild roles

### Set up your first role

Roles are how you control who gets what in your community. Each role can have different requirements to join and different rewards.

#### Configure your default role

**1. Access the role editor**

* Go to the **"Editor"** tab in your admin dashboard
* You'll see a default role called "Member" - this is your community's starting point\


**2. Make it yours**

* Upload a role image (128x128px works best)
* Edit the role title and description to explain what this role is about
* Keep it clear - this is often the first role people will see\


**3. Set your requirements**

* Click **"Add requirements"** to control who can access this role
* Edit the requirement image and text, or keep the default settings
* Common first requirements: Follow on Twitter, join Discord, or hold a specific token
* Use **"Should not satisfy"** to exclude certain members
* Adjust **"Should meet..."** at the top to decide if members need all requirements or just some\


**4. Add rewards**

* Click **"Add reward"** to give members something valuable
* Popular rewards: Discord roles, NFTs, and points
* Rewards activate automatically when members meet requirements\


**5. Save and create more**

* Save your changes to activate the role
* Click **"Empty role"** below existing roles to create additional roles

Most successful projects put their basic community roles - like Join Discord, Follow Twitter - on their home page, then create separate pages for campaigns or specialized subgroups like developers.

#### Test and go live

**Preview your work**

* Use **"View page as a visitor"** to experience what members will see
* Test that requirements work correctly and rewards claim properly
* Make sure your messaging is clear and the flow is simple

**Launch your community**

* Once everything looks good, your Guild URL is ready to share



Most projects begin with 2-5 key roles on their home page, then add membership tiers, quests, and specialized roles on new pages as their community grows.
