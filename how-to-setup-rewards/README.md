# How to setup rewards

Rewards are the benefits members receive when they qualify for roles. They are what makes your Guild valuable and give members clear incentives to engage with your community.

### Setting up rewards

**1. Add your first reward**

* In the role editor, click **"Add reward"**
* Choose from available reward types (Discord, Telegram, NFT, Points)
* Provide the configuration details needed for the reward type
* Add more rewards if you want\


**2. Save and test**

* Click **"Save"**
* Use **"View page as a visitor"** to see how rewards appear to members
* Qualified members will automatically see available rewards

### How rewards work for members

* Rewards are visible for all members but locked until requirements are met
* Rewards become available to claim once the requirements are met
* Members can claim rewards immediately by clicking the **"Claim"** button
* Rewards are granted instantly, but assigning Discord roles can take time due to Discord rate limits (members see a time estimation for when the role will be assigned)
* Members can see which rewards they have claimed\


{% hint style="info" %}
Most requirements sync automatically, so if someone stops meeting requirements and loses role access, they also lose reward access immediately.

### Common mistake to avoid

**Changing reward configurations:** If you remove/re-add a reward for an existing role, role members have to reclaim the rewards.
