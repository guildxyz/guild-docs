* Give your points a custom name or just use "points"
* Upload a custom icon to represent your points (optional)
  * Supported formats: PNG, JPG, SVG
  * Maximum file size: 5MB
* Create the point system and set how many points members receive for qualifying for this role
* Click **"Add reward"**
* A leaderboard is automatically created for each point system

{% endhint %}

#### How Points rewards work for members

* Members can claim points when they meet role requirements
* On the leaderboard, they can see their total points and rank
* You can use point totals as requirements for other roles to create progression systems
* Points are off-chain and managed entirely within Guild

#### Why use Points in your Guild

* **Progression** - Let members accumulate experience and unlock higher roles over time
* **Recognition** - Track and display meaningful contributions publicly
* **Incentives** - Reward valuable actions like attending events or completing tasks
* **Gamification** - Turn participation into an engaging experience with levels and tiers
* **Future utility** - Use point balances for allowlists, exclusive drops, or real-world rewards
