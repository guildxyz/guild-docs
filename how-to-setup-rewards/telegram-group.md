# Telegram group

Grant access to private Telegram groups automatically when members meet requirements. Perfect for gated communities, VIP channels, and holder-only discussions.

#### Setting up Telegram group rewards

**1. Add Guild bot to your Telegram group**

* In the role editor, click **"Add reward"** and select **Telegram**
* Click **"Add bot to group"** to open Telegram
* Select which Telegram group you want to gate
* Add the Guild bot as an admin with highest permissions\


**2. Configure the group**

* In your Telegram group, copy the group ID and paste it into the "Group ID" field on Guild
* Click **"Check"** then **"Add Telegram reward"**

{% hint style="info" %}
The Guild bot must have admin permissions in your Telegram group to automatically add and remove members.
{% endhint %}

#### How Telegram group rewards work for members

* Members see the Telegram group reward but cannot join until they meet role requirements
* Once qualified, members click **"Join group"** to get automatic access to the group
* Access is granted immediately through the Guild bot
* If members lose role access, they are automatically removed from the Telegram group

#### Requirements for setup

* You must be an admin of the Telegram group you want to gate
* The Guild bot must be added as an admin
* Your Telegram group must be set to "Private" (you can change this in your group settings under Group Type)
