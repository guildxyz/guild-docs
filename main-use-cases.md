# Main use cases

### 1. Token gating

Control who accesses what based on wallet holdings.

**How:** Set requirements like "Hold 100+ $TOKEN" or "Own Genesis NFT" to automatically gate access to Discord channels, Telegram groups, and more.

**Examples:**

* NFT projects gate holder-only Discord channels and exclusive drops
* DeFi protocols gate channels and give special access for token holders/stakers only
* Creators gate access to NFTs and content for collectors

Members get automatic access when they qualify and lose it immediately when they sell or transfer tokens. Works across 60+ EVM chains including Ethereum, Base, and Arbitrum.

No need to check wallets, update spreadsheets, or manually add/remove people. Guild checks onchain data 24/7 and updates access instantly.

### 2. Quests & campaigns

Run quests where people complete tasks to earn rewards.

**How:** Create multi-step quests combining onchain actions (make transactions, provide liquidity) with social tasks (follow on X, join Discord) and custom requirements. Track completion automatically and distribute rewards instantly or later.

**Quest examples:**

* **Onboarding quest:** "Follow on X + Join Discord + Interact with dApp" → Earn 10 points + Newcomer Discord role
* **DeFi quest:** "Swap on DEX + Provide liquidity on ETH/$TOKEN pool " → Collect NFT reward + DeFi user Discord role
* **Social quest:** "Like Tweet on X + Include ⛫ emoji in your X name + Join Telegram" → Earn 10 points + Social maxi Discord role
* **Ecosystem quest:** "Bridge at least 0.001 ETH to Base + Use these dApps + Own a .base domain + Complete feedback form" → Collect NFT + Based member Discord role

Create NFT rewards, set time limits and cap participation for exclusivity. Require previous quest completion, or create seasonal campaigns. Use different pages within your guild to keep it clean or for targeting specific groups, like developers.

Quests are perfect for user acquisition, new product launches, and driving specific behaviors across your ecosystem.

### 3. Membership management & onboarding

Create multiple roles for different purposes, group them into tiers, and guide new members through progressive onboarding.

**How:** Build a complete member journey from newcomer to top contributor. Create specific roles for tracking onchain and social activities and organize them into simple tiers for easy management. Design onboarding flows that guide people toward earning these roles and ranking up.

#### Create roles

Build roles that onboard and recognize different types of community value:

* **Newcomer:** Follow on X + Join Discord + Learn about the project
* **App User:** First app interaction + Supply minimum $10 USDC
* **Power User:** 20+ app interactions + Supply minimum $100 USDC + Stake 50+ $TOKEN
* **Developer:** GitHub commits + Deploy contract
* **Content Creator:** 5000+ X followers

#### Group roles into tiers

Organize your complex role system into simple tiers so members understand their status:

**3-tier example:**

* **Bronze:** Hold Guild roles + 10+ app interactions + Stake 10+ tokens
* **Silver:** Hold Guild roles + First app interaction 6+ months ago + 50+ app interactions + Stake 50+ tokens
* **Gold:** Hold Guild roles + First app interaction 1+ year ago + 100+ app interactions + Provide liquidity in the ETH/TOKEN pool + Stake 100+ tokens

Members know their tier, what they've achieved, and what's next. You get simple community management despite complex underlying roles.

Rewards can be Discord roles, exclusive NFTs, token airdrops, early product access, or custom perks. Members earn tiers when they qualify and lose them immediately when they no longer qualify.

This approach is great for making complex community structures clearer and simpler.

### 4. Sybil protection

Filter out fake accounts and bots using multiple verification layers.

**How:** Use our Guild Citizenship feature to better filter out sybil accounts. Or simply combine different requirement types that are more difficult for bots to satisfy. Combine onchain verification (wallet age, balance), social proof (account age, minimum number of followers), and other credential checks, such as GitHub commits.

**Protection strategies:**

* **Guild Citizenship:** Require a minimum humanity score that members have to collect to prove their humanity \[Learn more]
* **Wallet verification:** Require wallets with a 6+ month history, transactions on Ethereum, and minimal wallet balances
* **Social verification:** Require X & Discord accounts created before 2024 with a minimum of 100 X followers
* **Other**: Require a minimum Gitcoin passport score or a Coinbase attestation that verifies a member’s verified account on Coinbase.

It’s up to you how many and how strict the requirements you set.

Guild helps you better filter out sybils and reward real valuable members of your community.
