# Allowlist

An allowlist is a list of pre-approved wallet addresses or email addresses that grant access to specific roles. Perfect for exclusive launches, early access programs, or rewarding specific community members.

#### Setting up your allowlist

**1. Prepare your file**

* Create a .txt or .csv file with one entry per line
* **Wallet addresses:** Use EVM wallet addresses (e.g., 0x1234...)
* **Email addresses:** Use standard email format (user@example.com)
* **Mixed lists:** You can include both wallet addresses and emails in the same file\


**2. Upload and configure**

* In the role editor, click **"Add requirements"** and select **Allowlist**
* Upload your .txt or .csv file
* Name your allowlist to stay organized (e.g., "Early Testers", "Hackathon Winners 2024")
* Optionally upload a custom image to visually identify the list
* Click **"Add requirement"**



You can update allowlists anytime by uploading a new file - changes apply immediately. Current role holders who get removed from the updated allowlist will lose access automatically.
