* Choose **Account age** from the options
* Select a date and choose your logic:
  * **On** - Account created exactly on this date
  * **After** - Account created after this date
  * **Before** - Account created before this date

### Discord - Discord Member

Check server-specific information like roles, nicknames, and membership duration for members in Discord servers. You don't need to be an admin on the server, but you must be a member.&#x20;

#### Setting up server member requirements

**1. Configure the requirement**

* In the role editor, click **"Add requirements"** and go to **Discord**
* Choose **Discord member** from the options
* First select which Discord server to check
* Then choose what to verify:
  * **Role** - Member has a specific server role (most common)
  * **Nickname** - Member has a particular nickname set
  * **Server member since** - How long they've been in that server (uses same date logic as account age)
  * **Premium since** - When they got server premium (Nitro boosts)
* Customize the requirement name and image if you want
* Click **"Add requirement"**



Members connect Discord and Guild checks their status in the specified server. They must be in the target server for verification to work.
