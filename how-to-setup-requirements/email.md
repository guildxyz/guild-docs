# Email

Verify members have email addresses from specific domains. Perfect for gating access to employees, students, or verified community members from particular organizations.

**Setting up email requirements:**

* In the role editor, click **"Add requirements"** and select **Email**
* Choose **Verify an email with a domain**
* Enter the domain you want to check (e.g., guild.xyz, university.edu, company.com)
* This matches against the domain part of the member's verified email address
* Customize the requirement name and image if you want
* Click **"Add requirement"**

Members connect their email address and verify it through a confirmation link. Guild then automatically checks if the domain matches your requirements.
